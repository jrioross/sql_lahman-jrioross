11. Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? 
Use data from 2000 and later to answer this question. As you do this analysis, 
keep in mind that salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, 
so you may want to look on a year-by-year basis.

13. It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare,
causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective.
Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim.
First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers are compared with right-handed pitchers.
Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award?
Are they more likely to make it into the hall of fame?
