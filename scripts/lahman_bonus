/*
1. In this question, you'll get to practice correlated subqueries and learn about 
the LATERAL keyword. Note: This could be done using window functions, 
but we'll do it in a different way in order to revisit correlated subqueries 
and see another keyword - LATERAL.

a. First, write a query utilizing a correlated subquery to find the team with the most wins from each league in 2016.

If you need a hint, you can structure your query as follows:

SELECT DISTINCT lgid, ( <Write a correlated subquery here that will pull the teamid for the team with the highest number of wins from each league> )
FROM teams t
WHERE yearid = 2016;
*/

SELECT DISTINCT 
	lgid,
	(SELECT name
	 FROM teams AS st
	 WHERE t.lgid = st.lgid
	 	AND yearid = 2016
	 ORDER BY w DESC
	 LIMIT 1)
FROM teams AS t
WHERE yearid = 2016;

/*
b. One downside to using correlated subqueries is that you can only return exactly
one row and one column. This means, for example that if we wanted to pull in
not just the teamid but also the number of wins, we couldn't do so using just 
a single subquery. (Try it and see the error you get). 
Add another correlated subquery to your query on the previous part so that 
your result shows not just the teamid but also the number of wins by that team.
*/

SELECT DISTINCT 
	lgid,
	(SELECT name
	 FROM teams AS st
	 WHERE t.lgid = st.lgid
	 	AND yearid = 2016
	 ORDER BY w DESC
	 LIMIT 1),
	(SELECT w
	 FROM teams AS st
	 WHERE t.lgid = st.lgid
	 	AND yearid = 2016
	 ORDER BY w DESC
	 LIMIT 1)	 
FROM teams AS t
WHERE yearid = 2016;

/*
c. If you are interested in pulling in the top (or bottom) values by group,
you can also use the DISTINCT ON expression (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#SQL-DISTINCT). 
Rewrite your previous query into one which uses DISTINCT ON to return 
the top team by league in terms of number of wins in 2016. 
Your query should return the league, the teamid, and the number of wins.
*/

SELECT DISTINCT ON (lgid)
	lgid,
	name,
	w
FROM teams AS t
WHERE yearid = 2016
ORDER BY lgid, w DESC;

/*
d. If we want to pull in more than one column in our correlated subquery, 
another way to do it is to make use of the LATERAL keyword 
(https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-LATERAL). 
This allows you to write subqueries in FROM that make reference to 
columns from previous FROM items. This gives us the flexibility to 
pull in or calculate multiple columns or multiple rows (or both). 
Rewrite your previous query using the LATERAL keyword so that 
your result shows the teamid and number of wins for the team with 
the most wins from each league in 2016. 

If you want a hint, you can structure your query as follows:

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT lgid 
	  FROM teams
	  WHERE yearid = 2016) AS leagues,
	  LATERAL ( <Fill in a subquery here to retrieve the teamid and number of wins> ) as top_teams;
*/

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT lgid 
	  FROM teams
	  WHERE yearid = 2016) AS leagues,
	  LATERAL (SELECT
			  		name,
			  		w
			  	FROM teams AS t
			  	WHERE leagues.lgid = t.lgid
			   		AND yearid = 2016
			  	ORDER BY w DESC
			  	LIMIT 1) as top_teams;

/*
e. Finally, another advantage of the LATERAL keyword over using correlated 
subqueries is that you return multiple result rows. 
(Try to return more than one row in your correlated subquery from above 
and see what type of error you get). Rewrite your query on the previous 
problem sot that it returns the top 3 teams from each league 
in term of number of wins. Show the teamid and number of wins.
*/

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT lgid 
	  FROM teams
	  WHERE yearid = 2016) AS leagues,
	  LATERAL (SELECT
			  		name,
			  		w
			  	FROM teams AS t
			  	WHERE leagues.lgid = t.lgid
			   		AND yearid = 2016
			  	ORDER BY w DESC
			  	LIMIT 3) as top_teams;

/*
2. Another advantage of lateral joins is for when you create calculated columns. 
In a regular query, when you create a calculated column, you cannot refer to it when you create other 
calculated columns. This is particularly useful if you want to reuse a calculated column multiple times. 
For example,

SELECT 
	teamid,
	w,
	l,
	w + l AS total_games,
	w*100.0 / total_games AS winning_pct
FROM teams
WHERE yearid = 2016
ORDER BY winning_pct DESC;

results in the error that "total_games" does not exist. However, I can restructure this query using the LATERAL keyword.

SELECT
	teamid,
	w,
	l,
	total_games,
	w*100.0 / total_games AS winning_pct
FROM teams t,
LATERAL (
	SELECT w + l AS total_games
) AS tg
WHERE yearid = 2016
ORDER BY winning_pct DESC;

a. Write a query which, for each player in the player table, assembles their 
birthyear, birthmonth, and birthday into a single column called birthdate which is of the date type.
*/

SELECT (birthyear || '-' || birthmonth || '-' || birthday)::date AS birthdate
FROM people;

/*
b. Use your previous result inside a subquery using LATERAL to calculate for each player their age at debut and age at retirement.
(Hint: It might be useful to check out the PostgreSQL date and time functions 
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/functions-datetime.html).
*/

SELECT 
	namefirst,
	namelast,
	AGE(debut::date, birthdate) AS age_debut, 
	AGE(finalgame::date, birthdate) AS age_retire
FROM people,
LATERAL (
	SELECT (birthyear || '-' || birthmonth || '-' || birthday)::date AS birthdate
	) AS bd

/*
c. Who is the youngest player to ever play in the major leagues?
*/

SELECT 
	namefirst,
	namelast,
	AGE(debut::date, birthdate) AS age_debut, 
	AGE(finalgame::date, birthdate) AS age_retire
FROM people,
LATERAL (
	SELECT (birthyear || '-' || birthmonth || '-' || birthday)::date AS birthdate
	) AS bd
ORDER BY age_debut
LIMIT 1;

-- Joe Nuxhall debuted at age 15 years, 10 months, and 11 days

/*
d. Who is the oldest player to player in the major leagues? You'll likely have a lot of null values 
resulting in your age at retirement calculation. Check out the documentation on sorting rows here 
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/queries-order.html about how you can change how null values are sorted.
*/

SELECT 
	namefirst,
	namelast,
	AGE(debut::date, birthdate) AS age_debut, 
	AGE(finalgame::date, birthdate) AS age_retire

LIMIT 1;

/*
3. For this question, you will want to make use of RECURSIVE CTEs 
(see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/queries-with.html). 
The RECURSIVE keyword allows a CTE to refer to its own output. Recursive CTEs are useful for navigating 
network datasets such as social networks, logistics networks, or employee hierarchies 
(who manages who and who manages that person). To see an example of the last item, see this tutorial: 
https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-recursive-query/. 
In the next couple of weeks, you'll see how the graph database Neo4j can easily work with such datasets, 
but for now we'll see how the RECURSIVE keyword can pull it off (in a much less efficient manner) in PostgreSQL. 
(Hint: You might find it useful to look at this blog post when attempting to answer the following questions: 
https://data36.com/kevin-bacon-game-recursive-sql/.)
